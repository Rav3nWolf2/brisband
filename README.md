#Brisband


What is BrisBand?  BrisBand is a community-driven marketplace for local Brisbane musicians to discuss and to buy and sell their used equipment. 
BrisBand centralises interactions (e.g. opinions given on forums re instruments & recording gear, sale/borrowing of music equipment etc.) that already occur across a multitude of platforms, so that trade is a social and organic experience.

In the future we have big plans for BrisBand, we would like to add more to the site including; a venues page that will give all upcoming gigs and rehearsal spaces you can rent out or possible perform at. We’d also like to add a band page function, as to then have local bands and their instruments and a bio for each member.


1. What is the need (i.e. challenge) that you will be addressing in your project?

BrisBand has been developed to give musicians a place to share, discuss and sell used equipment. 

2. Identify the problem you’re trying to solve by building this particular marketplace App? Why is it a problem that needs solving?


We built BrisBand because currently there are multiple platforms to sell equipment on although none are community focused or have been developed for musicians and that’s how BrisBand will change this.


3. Describe the project will you be conducting and how. your App will address the needs.

Brisband is community centred and focused and by giving musicians the ability to connect with each other, as well as sell equipment. 
 

#THE TECHNICAL STUFF


#Network Infrastructure
#Describe the network infrastructure the App may be based on.
#(hardware, networks, data centers, facilities and related equipment used to develop, test, operate, monitor, manage and/or support information technology services.)


5. Identify and describe the software to be used in your App.

The programming software we used include; Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, HTML,CSS and SASS for the code and design bases. The application is built primarily on Rails, although we also included HTML for testing and code, we also incorporated the use of bootstrap, CSS and SASS to create tables and design.

Our third party software we are using are Postgres, stripe, Cloudinary, Ubuntu and Heroku.
Heroku was our deployment site alongside Cloudinary for storing and bring back the code to display the output you see on the screen.
Ubuntu was used in our coding environment.
And lastly the stipe component is for the payment systems for user to user payments 


6. Identify the database to be used in your App and provide a justification for your choice.


7. Identify and describe the production database setup (i.e. postgres instance).


8. Describe the architecture of your App.


9. Explain the different high-level components (abstractions) in your App.it was chosen because it enables the functionality in an efficient way.t

10. Detail any third party services that your App will use.


11. Describe (in general terms) the data structure of marketplace apps that are similar to your own (e.g. eBay, Airbnb).

12. Discuss the database relations to be implemented.

we began by creating wireframes, ERD's so that we could establish what functions were needed to be implemented.
we then built foundational database structure to implement features one by one.

13. Describe your project’s models in terms of the relationships (active record associations) they have with each other.

14. Provide your database schema design.

15. Provide User stories for your App.
stripe, image uploading, 

16. Provide Wireframes for your App.
stripe, postgres, 

17. Describe the way tasks are allocated and tracked in your project.


18. Discuss how Agile methodology is being implemented in your project.


19. Provide an overview and description of your Source control process.

20. Provide an overview and description of your Testing process.


21. Discuss and analyse requirements related to information system security

#Protecting Information & Data
22. Discuss methods you will use to protect information and data.

To protect information and data we have rolify and devise. s


23. Research what your legal obligations are in relation to handling user data.

In our research we came across the Privacy Act 1988.
Which states that in the case of user information being stored such as an email address or full name, there must be a privacy policy and or website disclaimer stating how the information is to be used. 
We have added a legal tab to the website in the navigation bar which covers all aspects of our obligations under the act.
