#Brisband


What is BrisBand?  BrisBand is a community-driven marketplace for local Brisbane musicians to discuss and to buy and sell their used equipment. 
BrisBand centralises interactions (e.g. opinions given on forums re instruments & recording gear, sale/borrowing of music equipment etc.) that already occur across a multitude of platforms, so that trade is a social and organic experience.

In the future we have big plans for BrisBand, we would like to add more to the site including; a venues page that will give all upcoming gigs and rehearsal spaces you can rent out or possible perform at. We’d also like to add a band page function, as to then have local bands and their instruments and a bio for each member.



#THE PROBLEM

1.What is the need (i.e. challenge) that you will be addressing in your project?

BrisBand has been developed to give musicians a place to share, discuss and sell used equipment. 



2.Identify the problem you’re trying to solve by building this particular marketplace App? Why is it a problem that needs solving?


We built BrisBand because currently there are multiple platforms to sell equipment on although none are community focused or have been developed for musicians and that’s how BrisBand will change this.


3.Describe the project will you be conducting and how. your App will address the needs.

Brisband is community centred and focused and by giving musicians the ability to connect with each other, as well as sell equipment. 
 

#THE TECHNICAL STUFF

#Network Infrastructure

#Describe the network infrastructure the App may be based on.


#(hardware, networks, data centers, facilities and related equipment used to develop, test, operate, monitor, manage and/or support information technology services.)



#Software

5.Identify and describe the software to be used in your App.

The programming software we used include; Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS and SASS for the code and design bases. The application is built primarily on Rails, although we also included HTML for testing and code, we also incorporated the use of bootstrap, CSS and SASS to create tables and design.

Our third party software we are using are Postgres, stripe, Cloudinary, Ubuntu and Heroku.
Heroku was our deployment site alongside Cloudinary for storing and bring back the code to display the output you see on the screen.
Ubuntu was used in our coding environment.
and lastly the stipe component is for the payment systems for user to user payments 


Q.6 How does the software work? 

It establishes a website with functionality for users to communicate and purchase.

Q.7 Why was this software chosen?
it was chosen because it enables the functionality in an efficient way.t

#Database
Q.8 Our app uses a PostgreSQL database.

Q. 9 Why was this database chosen over others?

#Production Database Setup
Q.10 What is the production database setup, i.e. postgres instance?

#Architecture
Q.11 How did we design & put together our app?

we began by creating wireframes, ERD's so that we could establish what functions were needed to be implemented.
we then built foundational database structure to implement features one by one.

Q.12 Why did we choose this architecture?

#High-Level Components
Q.13 What are the different high-level components (abstractions) of our app?
stripe, image uploading, 
#Third-Party Services
Q.14 What third-party services (e.g. APIs) are used?
stripe, postgres, 
#Data Structure
Q.15 In general, how do similar marketplace apps structure their data?


#Database Relations
Q.16 What database relations are implemented and why?

#Models
Q.17 What models did we create?

Q.18 What relationships (i.e. active record associations) do our models have with each other?
