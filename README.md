A community-driven social marketplace for musicians in Brisbane

#THE PROBLEM

#THE PROBLEM

• What is the need/challenge we are addressing in this project?

Brisband has been developed to give musicians a place to share, discuss and sell used equipment. 

•   Why does this problem need solving?

Currently there are multiple platforms to sell equipment on although none are community focused or have been developed for musicians and that’s how Brisband will change this.

•   How does this particular marketplace app propose to solve this problem?

Brisband is community centred and focused by giving musicians the ability to  connect with each other, as well as sell equipment.
